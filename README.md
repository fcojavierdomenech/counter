# counterapp
A counter application for andoid.

A simple and basic counter application. Over time, I'd like to extend it with more features, like:

- Storing the number of clicks in a database with it's hour, date and maybe a rating.
- Create a menu in which you can add/select what category you want to count.
- Graphic display in function of the stored data.
